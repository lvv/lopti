/***************************************************************************************************
This subroutine seeks the least value of a function of many variables,
by a trust region method that forms quadratic models by interpolation.
There can be some freedom in the interpolation conditions, which is
taken up by minimizing the Frobenius norm of the change to the second
derivative of the quadratic model, beginning with a zero matrix. The
arguments of the subroutine are as follows.

N	- number of variables and must be at least two.
NPT	- number of interpolation conditions. Must be in interval [N+2,(N+1)(N+2)/2].
X	- have X0 on invocation , argmin on exit
RHOBEG and RHOEND -  initial and final values of a trust
  region radius, so both must be positive with RHOEND<=RHOBEG. Typically
  RHOBEG should be about one tenth of the greatest expected change to a
  variable, and RHOEND should indicate the accuracy that is required in
  the final values of the variables.
IPRINT	- should be set to 0, 1, 2 or 3, which controls the
  amount of printing. Specifically, there is no output if IPRINT=0 and there is
  output only at the return if IPRINT=1. Otherwise, each new value of RHO is
  printed, with the best vector of variables so far and the corresponding value
  of the objective function. Further, each new value of F with its variables
  are output if IPRINT=3.

MAXFUN	- must be set to an upper bound on the number of calls of CALFUN.

W 	- will be used for working space. Its length must be at least (NPT+13)*(NPT+N)+3*N*(N+3)/2.

CALFUN (N,X,F) 	- must be provided by the user. It must set F to the value of the objective function for the variables X(1),X(2),...,X(N).

XBASE	- [N] 		hold a shift of origin that should reduce the contributions from rounding errors to values of the model and Lagrange functions.
XOPT	- [N] 		displacement from XBASE of the vector of variables that provides the least calculated F so far.
XNEW	- [N] 		displacement from XBASE of the vector of variables for the current calculation of F.
FVAL	- [NPT]		values of F at the interpolation points. 
GQ	- [N]		gradient of the quadratic model at XBASE.
HQ	- [(N*(N+1)+1)/2] explicit second derivatives of the quadratic model.
PQ	- [NPT]		parameters of the implicit second derivatives of the quadratic model.
XPT	- [NPT,N]	interpolation point coordinates relative to XBASE. 
NDIM	- 		first dimension of BMAT and has the value NPT+N.
BMAT	- [NPT+N,N]	last N columns of H.
ZMAT	- [NPTM, NPT] 	factorization of the leading NPT by NPT submatrix of H, this factorization being ZMAT times Diag(DZ) times ZMAT^T, where
	  		the elements of DZ are plus or minus one, as specified by IDZ.
D	- [N]	step from XOPT.
VLAG	- [NPT+N]	values of the Lagrange functions at a new point X.  They are part of a product that requires VLAG to be of length NDIM.
W	- will be used for working space. Its length must be at least 10*NDIM = 10*(NPT+N).

FOPT	- best F
KOPT	- index in FVAL of best F
