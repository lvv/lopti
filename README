LOPTI is open source C++ optimization library. There are three major parts.
1st and main part is solver-driver which either wraps external solver or uses
LOPTI native solvers and presents to library user consistent and simple
optimization API. 2nd part is collection of solvers.  Currently LOPTI have 4
solvers: 'NEWUOA', 'CONDOR', 'Nelder Mead' (simplex) and 'Hook-Jeevs'.  All
current solvers are derivative free and have open source (GPL or BSD like
licences).  Some of them (Condor) are unchanged and treated as black-box.  Some
of them (NEWUOA - fortran source) went through heavy modification to interface
with LOPTI.  And other (Hook-Jeevs) were completely rewritten into LOPTI native
solver.  3rd part is collection of object function and object function
modifiers.Â·
