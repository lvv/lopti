LOPTI is open source C++ optimization library. There are three major parts.
1st and main part is solver-driver which either wraps external solver or uses
LOPTI native solvers and presents to library user consistent and simple
optimization API. Currently LOPTI have 4 derivative free solvers: 'NEWUOA',
'CONDOR', 'Nelder Mead' (simplex) and 'Hook-Jeevs'.  2nd part is collection of
solvers.  All current solvers are open source (GPL or BSD like licences).  Some
of them (Condor) are unchanged and treated as black-box.  Some of them
(NEWUOA - fortran source) went through heavy modification to interface with LOPTI.  And
other (Hook-Jeevs) were completely rewritten into LOPTI native solver.  3rd
part is collection of object function and object function modifiers.
